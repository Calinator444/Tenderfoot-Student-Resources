# Tenderfoot Student Resources
 A student resource center for first year students



Troubleshooting:

When you first try to run the program you may encounter an error, something along the lines of "cannot locate bootstrap.min.css" I'm not sure why this keeps occurring but if it does try navigating to the "client" folder and running "yarn add bootstrap" (If you already have boostrap installed this will simply update it to the latest version).
